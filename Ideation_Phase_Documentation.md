## Project Name
Snack Squad: A Customizable Snack Ordering and Delivery App

## 1. Brainstorm & Idea Prioritization

### Step-1: Team Gathering, Collaboration and Select the Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to find quick, healthy, and personalized snack options that fit their dietary needs, preferences, and busy schedules. Traditional snack ordering lacks customization, leading to dissatisfaction, waste, and health issues. There is a need for an app that allows users to customize snacks, track orders in real-time, and receive deliveries efficiently, promoting healthier eating habits and convenience.

**Team Collaboration Notes:**  
- Team members gathered virtually to discuss user pain points identified from surveys and market research.  
- Consensus reached on focusing on customization and delivery as core features to differentiate from competitors like Uber Eats or local vending services.

### Step-2: Brainstorm, Idea Listing and Grouping

**Brainstormed Ideas:**  
We conducted a 30-minute brainstorming session using mind mapping techniques. Ideas were listed freely without judgment, then grouped into categories.

- **Customization Features:**  
  - Allow users to select ingredients (e.g., nuts, fruits, dairy-free options).  
  - Personalized snack packs based on dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, keto).  
  - Flavor profiles (spicy, sweet, savory) with user ratings.  

- **Ordering and Delivery:**  
  - Real-time order tracking with ETA updates.  
  - Scheduled deliveries for recurring orders.  
  - Integration with local vendors for fresh ingredients.  

- **User Experience:**  
  - In-app calorie and nutrition calculator.  
  - Loyalty rewards for repeat orders.  
  - Social sharing of custom snack creations.  

- **Technical Aspects:**  
  - AI recommendations based on past orders.  
  - Secure payment gateways (credit card, digital wallets).  
  - Mobile app with offline mode for order placement.  

- **Business Model:**  
  - Partnerships with health food brands.  
  - Subscription model for weekly snack boxes.  
  - Advertising space for related products.  

### Step-3: Idea Prioritization

**Prioritization Criteria:**

3. **User Experience Enhancements (Medium Impact, Medium Feasibility):** Improves satisfaction.  
4. **Technical Aspects (Medium Impact, Low Feasibility):** Advanced features for future iterations.  
5. **Business Model (Low Impact, High Feasibility):** Supports sustainability.
